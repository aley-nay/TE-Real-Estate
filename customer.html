We had been badly let down in the past and thought about giving up but when we seen a nice villa on the Turkey Expert web site that seem to fit the bill we phoned Cem. He explained to us that there had been a lot of intrest in the property and some people where looking at the villa that day but if they didnt want it he would hold it back until we managed to come to Turkey. To his credit he did exactly that we went and viewed the villa no pressure was put upon us at any time. After the veiwing my wife and I went to a nice restraunt over looking the docked cruise ships in the harbour and decide there and then that Peach Grove and Kusadasi was for us. With the upmost professionalism and help by Cem and Turkey Expert the deal was done.  Thanks very much for all your help Cem, Denise and Christine.</p>

We fell in love with one villa, but it was out of our price range, so Deniz spoke to the builder and he came back with an unbelievable offer of a bigger and better villa, but it would not be ready until the following year. If you know what you are looking for tell Deniz - she knows the property market like the back of her hand and if it is out there she will know about it!! Well, we have our deeds and everything has gone very straight forward thanks to Deniz and her hard work. Thanks again for helping make our dream come true!!</p>

I researched the country and decided that Kusadasi was the most desirable place to buy, for investment, for the beaches and for many other reasons. My next desicion was to chose a reputable and reliable company that could help me with my venture. I spoke to several companys in Kusadasi on the telephone and via email. Alot of these company gave me reasons to doubt there ability to find my dream villa but I was immediatley impressed with TURKEYEXPERT. Whilst liasing with Deniz from TURKEY EXPERT I was still speaking to a couple of other companys in case my faith was unfounded. TURKEY EXPERT have not yet ceased to impress me. I did not need to talk to any other company.They are professional, friendly, honest and helpful before,during and after the purchase of a villa. I arranged a trip to Kusadasi and was met at the airport. I was on a 3 day trip. I was shown every villa I asked to view and was never ever pressured into making a purchase. I was given sound advice by Cem and Christine and Deniz. I was only shown 1st class properties and every question I asked was answered without hesitation.
I have now bought a villa through TURKEY EXPERT and contracts signed. Since my purchase I have been in constant contact with Deniz and she has helped me with furnishings, advice on letting my villa and many other things

Nothing is to much trouble for TURKEY EXPERT and I highly recommend them to everyone. They will find you your dream villa. Without pressure. With a smile and do it all with upmost honesty and intergrity. Please email me if you want to know more...</p>

They are so honest and professional we feel they are like family.
We would recommend them to anybody and everybody.
You must take into account that the “System” and Way of Life in Turkey is so different to that of England but your finances will be safe in the hands of Turkey Expert.

When we flew to Turkey we met with Christine, Deniz and Cem they were really very welcoming and very helpful . They showed us all different types of properties and we had a friendly discussion over Lunch. We were really impressed with their hospitality. They were so down to earth and easy to talk to.
They gave us great advice about the property market in turkey and all about the Turkish traditions and culture. We found the dream villa that we had been looking for in Kusadasi. They have a great support network via phone and e-mail whilst you are in the process of buying your property.
I would highly recommend Turkey Expert to anyone. Not only do they help you buy a property but they advise you through the whole procedure and all the legal aspects and any hidden loop holes ect. If we had not of met Christine we would be still looking and unsure and probably lost in all the Turkish legal gargin.
Thank you Christine, Deniz and Cem.

We found them to be very friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and professional in dealing with the authorities and red tape when we purchased our property in Ozdere, informing us every step of the way making our purchase as easy and hassle free as buying a car.</p>
